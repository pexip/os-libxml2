Subject: [PATCH] Fix freeing of nested documents

Apparently, some libxslt RVTs can contain nested document nodes, see
issue #132. I'm not sure how this happens exactly but it can cause a
segfault in xmlFreeNodeList after the changes in commit 0762c9b6.

Make sure not to touch the (nonexistent) `content` member of xmlDocs.
